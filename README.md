# python-rpg
terminal based RPG game with dialogue and enemies!


# IMPORTANT
 If for some reason your thing doesn't run on vsCode it's most likely because your code runner doesn't have python3 included. So just go to your code runner settings and find the option where it says "Code runner execution map" and edit the json and find the python thing and add a 3 next to the python (If you are using python3 of course)
